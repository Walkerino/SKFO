/**
 * ProMailer “Subscribe” page template file
 * 
 * Please see this URL for these instructions in HTML:
 * https://processwire.com/store/pro-mailer/manual/#about-the-promailer-subscribe-page-template-file
 * 
 * This template file should be named: /site/templates/promailer-subscribe.php
 * and should be used by 1 page in your site (which ProMailer sets up for you). 
 * Feel free to modify anything in this file as you see fit. 
 * 
 * The purpose of this template file is to manage subscriptions and un-subscriptions
 * for ProMailer. It also is also the endpoint for webhook submissions from your mail
 * delivery service (if used). If you are not using user initiated subscribe/unsubscribe 
 * features then you do not need this template file or the page using it. If you do 
 * want these features (and most likely you do) then read on…
 * 
 * 1. As it currently stands, this template file just outputs a form to subscribe or 
 *    unsubscribe. It needs to be updated to work with your output strategy. Depending
 *    on your output strategy, you should modify this file as follows: 
 * 
 *    - If you are using direct output, you'll want to add include() statements for your 
 *      header/footer files where output is rendered at the bottom of this file. 
 * 
 *    - If you are using delayed output, you'll want to modify the last line in this file 
 *      containing the `$out` variable to populate whatever variable you need, i.e. 
 *     `$bodycopy = $out;` or similar. 
 * 
 *    - If you are using Markup Regions, you'll want to modify the last line in this file 
 *      to be something like `echo "<div id='content'>$out</div>";` where "content" would 
 *      be the id of the element you want to populate.
 * 
 *    - If you aren't sure what you are using, then leave things as they are for now and
 *      try to view the page using this template file to see whether or not it works. Make
 *      adjustments as needed, or post in the ProMailer support board and we can help
 *      you figure it out. 
 * 
 * 2. This file contains several options and markup that you can modify as needed. For
 *    instance, you may want to update the form markup, and the error/success message markup.
 *    Or you may want to modify the labels used for fields and/or error/success messages. 
 *    Or maybe you want to modify the contents of the confirmation email that a user receives
 *    after subscribing to your list. When it comes to markup, numerous placeholders like 
 *    “{this}” are used, and those are tags that ProMailer replaces with the appropriate 
 *    text during rendering. 
 * 
 * 3. If you'd like, you can make your own subscribe form completely independent of this file, 
 *    and then simply use the page (represented by this template file) as the form processor.      
 *    If you go that route, then specify false for the 'useCSRF' option on the subscribe form,
 *    make sure you use the same form 'action' attribute and input name attributes. For instance,
 *    the email field should be named "subscribe_email" and the submit field should be named
 *    "subscribe_submit". 
 * 
 * 4. If you want to use webhooks to manage things like bounces, copy the file having the name
 *    /site/modules/ProMailer/promailer-webhooks.inc to your /site/templates/ directory. This
 *    template file will detect and include it when present. Read the documentation in the 
 *    promailer-webhooks.inc file for more information about how to use it. 
 * 
 * 5. If you want to render a subscribe form from another page template file, you may 
 *    include this file from other template files and it will simply output the subscribe form
 *    at the location where you include it: include('./promailer-subscribe.php'); 
 * 
 * There are a few examples of hooks you can use in the promailer-hooks.php file included
 * with ProMailer. Feel free to copy/paste any of those into your /site/ready.php file if
 * they suit your needs.

 * SUBSCRIBE FORM AND OPTIONS
 * 
 * 1. Modify the form markup for the subscribe form below as needed. You may use the following 
 *    placeholders in the markup, which are automatically replaced with the necessary values by
 *    ProMailer when the form is rendered: 
 *
 *    {list} - Title of the list being subscribed to
 *    {list_id} - ID of the list being subscribed to (you probably do not need this).
 *    {url} - URL the form should submit to, aka action attribute (required). 
 *    {email_name} - Name for the email input field (required).
 *    {email_placeholder} - Placeholder text for email input (optional).
 *    {submit_name} - Name attribute for the submit button (required).
 *    {submit_label} - Text label for submit button (optional). 
 *    {honeypot} - This is replaced with an invisible spam-prevention honeypot input (optional). 
 *    {extras} - Extra markup & hidden inputs that ProMailer needs to place in the form (required). 
 * 
 * 2. If you have any custom fields you also want to use, please do the following:
 * 
 *   - Add new inputs for them in the form markup, using your own markup. You do NOT have to use
 *     placeholders for attributes or labels like the default fields, just write the markup how
 *     you usually would. 
 * 
 *   - For the name attributes, use the same names you defined for the “Define custom fields” 
 *     section of your List in the ProMailer admin. 
 * 
 *   - For any required fields, add an HTML5 required="required" attribute to the <input>.
 * 
 * 3. Modify the “Subscribe options” ($subscribeOptions) array that appears below the form 
 *    markup. There are many settings, feel free to modify as you see fit, though for most the
 *    defaults are just fine. Please at least populate the 'emailFrom' option, which will be 
 *    used as the “from” address on the double opt-in confirmation email that the user receives
 *    to confirm their subscription. 
 * 
 * 4. If using multi-language support, translate this file (/site/templates/promailer-subscribe.php)
 *    in Setup > Languages > each language, as needed.
